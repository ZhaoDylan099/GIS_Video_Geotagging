0,3785,00:19:05.00,[00:22:14]  This building right here on the left. There's a monitoring thing in there for air quality control.,99.33
1,3747,00:12:27.00,[00:15:36]  From the factories? Just the truck traffic.,99.29
2,3890,00:44:25.00,"[00:47:34]  And that's concerning, because this wraps all the way around, right around the village because if we would have kept down Harvard passed the Speedway gas station, the whole valley by the harbor Dennison Bridge is all steel mill, and it's always working, so it’s very close. ",99.14
3,3777,00:18:10.00,"[00:21:19]  This is all part of the steel mill now, okay.",99.12
4,3742,00:11:40.00,[00:14:49]  And so then what is this big Factory up to the right? ,99.01
5,3750,00:13:14.00,[00:16:23]  Up here because it's actually back here. Part of that steel mill and then there's two. ,98.92
6,3790,00:19:49.00,"[00:22:58]  And that's where the air quality monitors is? It's around the corner. I'll show you, it’s right by the BP station.",98.84
7,3778,00:18:13.00,[00:21:22]  See all them good buildings back there? That's all part of the steel mill. You could drive it on this street. ,98.76
8,3749,00:12:54.00,"[00:16:03] Sure, and if you go down here over the bridge, the Harvard Dennison Bridge, which just a short distance, that's all part of the steel mill and that's a constantly working and that's constantly producing all kinds of stuff into the air which of course, you know shifts over here. ",98.44
9,3783,00:18:50.00,[00:21:59]  And so when you said this was one of the top polluters. You were talking about the steel mill?,98.43
10,3836,00:29:26.00,"[00:32:35]  This is Raus Park, and there used to be as you can see down there is the backstop. It's a very nice area. We wanted to develop this. We're not getting a lot of cooperation from anywhere that has been in office, and especially now, Mr. Bibb, they, you know, are okay with just cutting it and not doing anything with it. But you know, this would be a perfect little retirement community, this could be condos. This could be anything.",98.08
11,3744,00:11:48.00,[00:14:57]  And what do they produce? They do something with Aerospace.,98.06
12,3745,00:11:57.00,"[00:15:06]  This is all of that. Oh, it's all from Howmet right on the right. Okay, that's like the offices there and then back there's like the factory.",97.46
13,3817,00:25:09.00,"[00:28:18]  There's some factories over here, Timex plastic that still works.",96.95
14,3804,00:21:38.00,"[00:24:47]  There's fire trucks. There's city of Cleveland, you know all kinds of tractors and so many.",96.87
15,3784,00:18:55.00,"[00:22:04]  The steel mill, because we have two, the village is flanked by steel mills one on this side one on this side. So, you put the two together and it's not a good look.",96.86
16,3872,00:39:25.00,"[00:42:34]  And that's the Horticulture Center they've talked about a lot of things. I've heard they're going to put the Mounted Police in there. He now owns this building, and this is what they're turning into. They showed me all the blueprints. They're turning it into like a meeting Center, Party Center, whatever. They have big plans for all of it. They’re like one building at a time kind of thing. Yeah.",96.66
17,3812,00:23:52.00,"[00:27:01]  Okay, I'm going to do some investigation later and figure out what that is, because I don't think I've ever seen the EPA air quality monitors before.",96.66
18,3740,00:10:52.00,"[00:14:01]  It's their Public Works garage where they store all their big equipment and you know, excavators, and kind of crazy stuff and they have they have a lot of events here. They do the voters when they teach people how to work at the voting polls.",96.36
19,3803,00:21:16.00,"[00:24:25]  And this is the division of water, part of it, the whole thing. This used to be motor vehicle maintenance. I don't know if that's what this still is. Tt was the police garage where they took all the vehicles to die. And then a couple times a year they have like an auction and auction off.",96.25
20,3726,00:07:19.00,"[00:10:28]  Harvard is the dividing line for two communities on the North side, which is where we are. It's Newburg Heights on the south side, except for about 50 to 80 feet, depending, is Cuyahoga Heights. So, we have a little bit of every parking lot from maybe you know, I don't know half a mile that way all the way down, but the bulk of the businesses and the buildings and the taxes and everything go to Cuyahoga Heights. ",95.66
21,3940,01:02:58.00,"[01:06:07] Yeah, it's the building right by Charter Steel.",95.61
22,3787,00:19:25.00,[00:22:34]  Is it an EPA monitor or like a privately? ,95.1
23,3869,00:38:45.00,"[00:41:54]  This is our soccer field, again part of the Metro Parks. All this back in through here is a trail that you can walk and yeah, it's really beautiful. It is very pretty back here, and they just had a plant sale. ",94.93
24,3729,00:08:07.00,"[00:11:16]  Correct. We got Howmet, we got Charter Steel, that’s the steel company that I told you two on 49th Street back there. South of us. ",94.69
25,3943,01:03:28.00,"[01:06:37] And people by the water company over there, at the end of 42nd, Their trucks are grey or brown. From that stuff in that building. They do recycling, metal from the Charter steel and they bring It up from Elton D or whatever, it's down here and they crush It and the building They're doing it in. And there's no door just pours out.",94.3
26,3763,00:15:59.00,"[00:19:08]  And this used to have a Holcomb’s, right? You guys know that I was there for almost 19 years, you know until they closed. What is Holcomb’s? It was an educational supplies Warehouse these supplied all those daycares in the schools, and I went in there all the time on my kids were little for like poster board and you know, all that stuff for projects. ",93.95
27,3727,00:07:48.00,"[00:10:57]  So they're the biggest polluters. We get the traffic, we get the dirt we get all of that, but we don't get any Revenue. Zero. From any of these businesses except on the north side.",93.75
28,3823,00:26:09.00,[00:29:18]  Can we pop on the freeway and see the other steel mill? Sure.,93.36
29,3736,00:09:30.00,"[00:12:39]  This is our largest park. I think Trevor told me it was like almost four acres, but they call it “the cap” I think and that's where all the radioactive debris was remediated and then buried. Nothing can ever build on there. It's a beautiful sight, but we can't put anything on there ever. We still get a little bit of residue- ",93.08
30,3748,00:12:48.00,[00:15:57]  Do you ever see um smoke or any physical element coming out of the Howmet factory? ,92.97
31,3756,00:14:40.00,[00:17:49]  So this is where there’s all the semi-trucks. Correct? ,91.89
32,3732,00:08:23.00,"[00:11:32]  Yeah, they get lots of money. The residential portion of Cuyahoga Heights is very far from there. They have a big industrial complex off of Grant Avenue. They have things that you know that they do for the residents that we could never do. They still pull their garbage cans out every day and I mean every time and put them back.",91.23
33,3932,00:59:14.00,"[01:02:23]  All this back here is capped off underneath and I don't know how far there's radioactive crap there's a 20-foot layer of clay, there's some compacted material and we can never build on this this would now awesome.",90.14
34,3751,00:13:27.00,"[00:16:36]  This is a transfer station. What happens here, Ohio Bulk and Rumpke share this space and they take all kinds of trash and debris from other communities. They literally transfer it to either bigger containers or different containers and they send it to wherever it's going to go. ",89.74
35,3838,00:30:34.00,"[00:33:43]  The park where the radioactive stuff is, like we had talked a couple times about maybe putting up a windmill. Yeah, you know stuff like that, but we can never build on it. ",88.73
36,3789,00:19:44.00,[00:22:53]  This building right here and look at the windows. ,88.43
37,3788,00:19:31.00,"[00:22:40]  I think it’s an EPA monitor because we had those guys those people those two people come from air quality control and that they were the ones that were talking about it, but they weren’t very knowledgeable. No, they were, I was just a little disappointed.",88.24
38,3867,00:38:22.00,"[00:41:31]  Yeah over here we have the Metroparks, we have our Memorial. This was the Horticulture center from Cleveland Public Schools, which is now closed.",88.03
39,3830,00:28:03.00,"[00:31:12]  Raus Park. Yeah. Okay. We have an area that is in Newburgh, but it is owned by the city of Cleveland. It's called Raus Park, R A U S, years ago there was a baseball field there. It was very well maintained.",86.66
40,3713,00:03:18.00,"[00:06:27] Okay. So basically, the overall goal is to drive around hopefully no faster than 25 miles per hour and talk about anything that you observe in the neighborhood relating to air quality or really anything at all. This is more just like a space for you guys to talk and show your concerns and then we'll be able to relate your words back to where the concerns are spatially. ",85.98
41,3774,00:17:51.00,"[00:21:00]  That's our village, Senior Center, Village Hall, council chambers, mayor's office.",85.33
42,3868,00:38:30.00,"[00:41:39]  But the First Tee, the golf course, which is behind it, they are gonna lease that property and they're gonna put up a big community center for the village and for the surrounding area. So yeah, they have big plans. ",84.56
43,3847,00:31:50.00,"[00:34:59]  We look like we live by a steel mill, and this is what houses near steel mills look like, that black soot all over them.",84.23
44,3927,00:57:04.00,[01:00:13]  So do you have air conditioning? ,82.53
45,3781,00:18:27.00,[00:21:36]  Trying to help with noise reduction because that was a real problem here in the village. They were dropping steel at all hours of the day and night and people were complaining about because it's like a freight train coming through your house.,82.23
46,3861,00:37:47.00,[00:40:56]  Tree City USA. There's a lot of trees. ,81.75
47,3813,00:24:29.00,"[00:27:38]  All right. This is our main thoroughfare, Harvard. It's a state route. We do get some funding for this to clean it up and patch it and do things like that. But a lot of truck traffic a lot of school Bus traffic",80.51
48,3819,00:25:31.00,[00:28:40]  It’s a food desert. Yeah. There's no grocery stores. ,79.61
49,3717,00:04:03.00,"[00:07:12] Okay. Harshaw chemical was making things for World War Two, probably Korea as well. And this is just where they dumped everything because that's what they did. It was capped off by the EPA and there was a huge lawsuit. One of our former mayors took it upon herself to say hey, this has got to be cleaned up. ",78.13
50,3911,00:52:25.00,"[00:55:34]  It's you know, it's a nice Community. It really is. And are these houses that are backing up to the train? Correct.",77.69
51,3873,00:39:56.00,"[00:43:05]  So this is the golf course, that's the clubhouse. ",77.53
52,3728,00:08:00.00,[00:11:09]  Cuyahoga Heights is polluting it and then you guys are receiving the pollution right but they're not getting any of the benefits.,76.47
53,3874,00:41:31.00,[00:44:40]  Are there any places where people avoid because of the air quality?,75.98
54,3715,00:03:49.00,"[00:06:58] And I also wanted to share that years ago, this area back here was a radioactive dump and I mean 50-75 years ago. Is that about right now? ",75.45
55,3834,00:29:09.00,"[00:32:18]  I use bleach and that's what I was told it was, it was graphite from the mill. ",75.12
56,3915,00:53:27.00,[00:56:36]  this is just the back Part of Village Hall. That's Harvard again.,74.83
57,3775,00:18:00.00,[00:21:09]  This is our fire department. All of this is brand new within the last 10 years. ,74.74
58,3826,00:27:02.00,"[00:30:11]  We have a couple parks. Well, if we go along Washington Park Boulevard, you'll see we have a lot of Green Space.",74.23
59,3810,00:22:13.00,"[00:25:22]  We are now getting out of Newburgh, but I think this is the air quality thing. I'm not positive. ",73.83
60,3893,00:45:08.00,"[00:48:17]  Like sometimes like rotten eggs, just sulfur. Yeah. I'm not sure what it is. And that’s from the steel mill.",72.21
61,3879,00:42:35.00,"[00:45:44]  Newburgh gets slated to have sewer separations done. They started downtown. We're next. I believe next year. They're going to take half of this and do half of going Southbound and then they're going to do the other half going northbound and hopefully gets our area we're working on it. We've gotten so much of the village done already. I know you guys have. But again, with the budget to share we had you know, you guys on hold. I understand.",71.75
62,3908,00:51:07.00,"[00:54:16]  That house just sold for 180,000. But it came with the lot next door to it. ",71.35
63,3761,00:15:35.00,[00:18:44]  And where are all these trucks coming from over on the right? ,71.05
64,3933,00:59:30.00,"[01:02:39]  And I see okay, so that's the pile. We can walk back there, I mean if you're not going to die, but I wouldn't grow things. ",69.22
65,3841,00:31:12.00,[00:34:21]  Is that a concern of the residents of Newburgh Heights? Absolutely. And that's why a lot of people don't we don't use that space because people do have concerns about it. ,68.93
66,3739,00:10:38.00,"[00:13:47]  It needs to be updated and you know, it's been it's been worn a little bit, but it's been used for sure. Now we go a little bit further this way. This is Cuyahoga County's, is it their maintenance land? ",68.1
67,3818,00:25:11.00,"[00:28:20]  Blue coral, are they still here? Is Blue Coral still up and running? They were here in this building. This Family Dollar is, except for gas stations, The only place you could buy anything to eat like to cook at home you need, you know, they don't have produce and things like that, but we were thrilled to get you know, just something where we buy a loaf of bread that wasn’t 14 dollars.",67.23
68,3857,00:36:42.00,[00:39:51]  We could even look at the parts of Cleveland that most border Newburgh Height since we have access to some of that data. ,66.9
69,3864,00:37:59.00,[00:41:08]  This is called the boulevard. Some people call it the Horseshoe because it goes completely around to Harvard and it’s a really a pretty area. ,66.8
70,3771,00:17:26.00,[00:20:35]  And are those rentals mainly like single family or apartments? ,65.91
71,3871,00:39:12.00,"[00:42:21]  And not that it's that noteworthy, but that's my house right there. No, that's her backyard right here. She owns this lot, and her house is right directly behind it. ",64.52
72,3837,00:30:18.00,"[00:33:27]  And that park doesn't necessarily have the same radioactive concern that would inhibit- no. So, there's really no reason why things couldn’t be developed on it. Correct. We just don't have permission to do anything with it. ",60.08
73,3815,00:25:00.00,"[00:28:09]  What do you have to say about this area? Ladies, anything? ",58.5
74,3903,00:47:57.00,[00:51:06]  That's where they move the playground equipment to back there. You can rent that Pavilion like you can rent Squires Castle. It's really like that. Nice little place. ,58.16
75,3899,00:46:14.00,"[00:49:23]  Oh the mayor was terrific, the previous mayor. That's the gentleman who was walking around. He's our former major. He was literally the best mayor this town ever had. If somebody complained about something he was on it. Yes, when the residents were complaining about the noise from the mill, you know at all hours of the night, he immediately went after them and they worked with us they had us in for this big luncheon, and we toured the steel mill. They showed us all the work that they did. So, I was really happy about that. ",58.05
76,3760,00:15:04.00,"[00:18:13]  Not so much the dust but the particulates that are getting into the air from all the sitting garbage and you know, I mean, I don't know if that means anything but wouldn't want to live there and have to deal with that all the time. ",58.02
77,3848,00:32:00.00,"[00:35:09]  When you go to Pittsburgh, it's very prominent.",57.14
78,3820,00:25:37.00,"[00:28:46]  Bars, we got bars. Well, all the way up the street is a Dave's Supermarket, which you got to go into Cleveland. ",56.8
79,3738,00:10:12.00,"[00:13:21]  It is popular. We have all of our large events there. We have our Fall Fest there. You can rent the Pavilion and have a birthday party, wedding party, whatever. We had years ago, one of our council members got a grant and put in some, I hate to say disabled. I can't even think of the word but able-bodied and disabled playground equipment, right?",56.51
80,3766,00:16:51.00,[00:20:00]  Most of the residents they've been here for a long time? ,54.96
81,3721,00:06:27.00,"[00:09:36]  It's really a cute little neighborhood. It's back away from everything. Everybody knows each other and there's a beautiful view of downtown. Yes, at nighttime yes.",54.57
82,3902,00:47:43.00,"[00:50:52]  I’m gonna go past the police Department to see if we can see any of the cars there and how bad they look. Yeah, but this is part of the Cleveland Metroparks. This is Washington.",54.55
83,3772,00:17:30.00,"[00:20:39]  A lot of two-family homes, upstairs, downstairs.",53.9
84,3716,00:03:58.00,"[00:07:07] Well, we settled with them in 1994. ",53.34
85,3887,00:44:01.00,"[00:47:10]  It was ArcelorMittal, wasn’t it?",52.99
86,3863,00:37:55.00,[00:41:04]  But look how nice these homes are maintained on the boulevard. I mean.,52.66
87,3896,00:45:49.00,"[00:48:58]  I was gonna say that some that is something that you definitely need pictures of., and then you sent them to the EPA and nothing? ",52.59
88,3845,00:31:38.00,[00:34:47]  I see a lot of houses have a black film on it.,51.33
89,3769,00:17:12.00,"[00:20:21]  Yeah, I'm 35 years, And I'm one of the younger people who've been here. So now there's a lot of I think we're almost at 50% rentals. Is that true then?",50.72
90,3779,00:18:19.00,[00:21:28]  they did spend a lot of money several years ago.,48.12
91,3741,00:11:12.00,"[00:14:21]  And right there you see that sign. That is Cuyahoga Heights. Okay. So Newburgh ends right here. We are this, we get the money for this and the taxes for this and it's wonderful, it’s been a wonderful addition to our community, and you know, it's good for them too because they're really right by all of the you know, major freeways. They can get on 71, 77, 176. So, wherever they need to go they can go. ",47.89
92,3752,00:13:51.00,[00:17:00]  We've had some problems with stockpiling garbage in semis down here at several residence called about the smell. ,47.8
93,3824,00:26:16.00,[00:29:25]  This on the right-hand side is Cleveland. And on the left-hand side is Newburgh. We only have a very few homes on this street.,47.42
94,3929,00:57:18.00,[01:00:27]  That's why I run my air conditioning all the time because I don’t want to deal with the dirt.,47.37
95,3918,00:54:15.00,"[00:57:24]  Yeah, this car's got spots all over it.",47.23
96,3878,00:42:10.00,"[00:45:19]  That's the main memorial, it's part of the ship, the main that blew up, I want to say during the Spanish-American War, but don't quote me on that, and we somehow got part of that.",47.01
97,3852,00:34:12.00,"[00:37:21] One of the things we haven't talked about, and it really is, I think a bonus feature here. We have a lot of wildlife. I mean, we have a lot of deer, we have coyotes, everywhere. We see turkeys, we've seen deer, Linda said coyotes, rabbits, skunks, squirrels, everything. When they meet the golf course, they did tear down a lot of trees and you know, we could golf course, but the animals did not leave and it's a very nice. It’s a jewel in the middle of the city. ",46.38
98,3888,00:44:05.00,"[00:47:14]  Well, you see they're working 24/7 over here. ",45.75
99,3722,00:06:45.00,[00:09:54]  There's my house. There's our yard.,45.73
100,3754,00:14:08.00,"[00:17:17]  It's hard to really see the damage that this stuff has done from a distance. You would have to well like I showed you our house, our windows and everything. You would have to kind of see it up close as to what happens daily with this stuff. ",45.23
101,3858,00:36:54.00,[00:40:03] There’s some type of reciprocal relationship that Newberg and Bratton will have with Cleveland. We are part of their Cleveland Municipal School District for sure. ,43.19
102,3856,00:36:19.00,"[00:39:28]  There was a lot of people in in my little area too that died from cancer. A lot. But I know today, you know, we're all being bombarded with, you know, cell phones and computers and everything and you're getting all that electromagnetic crap your microwave whatever, but is it higher here?

221,3833,00:28:52.00,[00:32:01]  Sometimes it's really hard to clean. Like I took some pictures in my windowsills. I just cleaned them the other day and I took a toothbrush literally to get like in the corners and stuff and I still couldn't get that black. It's like graphite. ,2.34
222,3942,01:03:20.00,"[01:06:29] Yeah, it's been really bad now because even all of our patrol cars, our city trucks. Two nights out, they're black.",2.25
